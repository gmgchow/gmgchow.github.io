summary: Last Friday was my last day at JCV Softbank, where I worked for exactly one year.

(EN/JA/ZH) Last week was my last working day at Japan Computer Vision (JCV), a Softbank subsidiary that develops facial recognition AI products. I joined in July 2022, exactly one year ago.

# Life at JCV

## What I did

As the first and only Security Engineer within the product team, I mostly worked on building application security processes including the security testing flow and integration of SAST/DAST into the development pipeline, as well as performing penetration testing of web, mobile, API, and IoT products.

I mostly worked full-remote and rarely went to the office, but the office is located at the Softbank headquarters in Tokyo Portcity Takeshiba. It's a stylish and new office building that has lush greenery outside, high-tech cleaning robots inside, panoramic ocean views, and everything from restaurants to convenience stores throughout the building!

*Cleaning robots at rest. They are mostly only active during non-business hours, in order to avoid getting in people's ways.*

I personally really enjoyed the Softbank cafeteria (for some reason, it's nicknamed "Cafeshiba") and often went there whenever I went to the office. Most people seemed to order the Japanese items like curry, udon, etc. but I always ordered the melted cheese sandwich from the cafe! They even have a good assortment of sweets, so it was my favorite place.

Of course, I also sometimes worked there because it is decently quiet during off-peak times, and the ocean view is stunning.

The food at the cafeteria is not free, but still fairly cheap (around 500yen can get you a meal).

# Memories

## Working in a trilingual background

For me, the most interesting thing about working at JCV is that the work environment uses three languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese!

Since I don't see myself working in China or Taiwan in the future, this may be my first and last time using Mandarin Chinese at work so it was quite the experience. I initially struggled to keep up (and honestly, still do...), but listening to technical discussions in Chinese and reading Slack channels fully written in Chinese has helped me improve so much. I even passed HSK6 earlier this year so I'm really thankful that I had the opportunity to work in such a diverse environment!

*I only barely passed HSK6 but without the help of my colleagues, I definitely would not have passed at all.*

Of course, not every person is fluent in all three languages. Some can only speak one, some can speak 1.5, and some are indeed completely fluent in all three. I myself am only fluent in English and am still learning Chinese and Japanese, so I felt nothing but deep respect towards colleagues who are fully-fluent in all three.

## Playing with facial recognition devices

Dear Readers, how many of you have seen this device around Japan?

*JCV's SenseThunder thermal camera was a common sight at shopping centers, movie theaters, and restaurants all across Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.*

One really fun aspect of working at JCV is that I was able to work on this, along with other facial recognition products that can be seen around Japan so I felt like my work was visible and making a difference in society. Every time I passed by one of these devices in the public, I had to hold back the urge to tell people, "Look, my company made this! I did the security work for it!"

## Enjoying WeWork life

Personally, my favorite benefit at JCV is that employees are allowed to use any WeWork location. Working at home can get boring, and sometimes I had plans after work so it was much more convenient to work from more central areas of Tokyo like Shinjuku or Shibuya. At those times, I made reservations at other WeWork locations.

In my time at JCV, I actually went to quite a few WeWork locations in Tokyo and Yokohama, and even to one location in Osaka!

Being able to work from anywhere while enjoying the free coffee/tea and quiet, clean, and comfortable working spaces was seriously awesome, and it is a perk that I will really miss.

*In addition to free coffee and tea, WeWork also has free beer taps, self-checkout snack shops, break rooms, beautiful and clean washrooms, and even changing rooms with makeup mirrors!*

# Why I left

The two reasons I told the team are the following:

1) Career growth: As the sole Security Engineer at JCV, I gained lots of hands-on experience in building security processes and penetration testing throughout this past year. It led me to think about the next step in my career and unfortunately, I did not see myself being able to achieve my career goals by staying at JCV. At the same time, a suitable opportunity unexpectedly came to me, so I took it.

2) Culture misfit: As many people know, Mercari (my previous company) has a very distinctive culture where engineers don't only spend their time on product development. Many (if not most) employees are actively-involved in the local tech scene through attending and presenting at tech conferences, holding meetup events, and giving back to the community by sharing knowledge through tech blogs or open-source software. Many teams even have rules where they are allowed to spend a portion of work time on research or personal development through taking training courses or certifications. Perhaps I have grown too fond of this type of company culture; it was difficult for me to adapt and I couldn't find motivation through only working on tasks related to the next product release-- I wanted something *more*. Unfortunately, JCV is still a young startup so it was unable to offer the kind of culture that I am looking for.

# Moving forward

For the remainder of the summer, I will go back to Canada to spend some time with my friends and family! During this period, I will also spend time studying security and certifications, and also preparing for my next role.

At this moment, I will not reveal where my next role is or what I will be doing, but it is *a bit* different from what I have done so far, so I will study hard to make sure that I can hit the ground running! Please look forward to my next blog post where I will talk more about my new role.

It was a short time at JCV but it definitely feels like more than a year has passed because I learned so much about startup life, cybersecurity, and myself and my own career goals. It was a great experience so thank you for everything, JCV!

I wish the team all the best and look forward to seeing their AI products around!
