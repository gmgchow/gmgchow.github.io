Welcome to my new blog!

I've been wanting to make a personal website and blog since forever but somehow I never found the time for it. Currently, I'm on vacation back in Vancouver so I finally found some time to get started!

I will mostly be blogging about topics that interest me such as the tech industry, cybersecurity, psychology, career and self-improvement, language learning, books I read, Japan life, etc.

Some upcoming posts:
- A retrospective about my time at Mercari, my previous company that I recently resigned from
- My first time choosing between multiple job offers and negotiating salary
- Reviews of books that I read recently and want to recommend

This site is looking kind of ugly at the moment because I used a premade theme, so I plan to make some improvements:
- Customize the theme
- Add Japanese and Chinese translations (WARNING: As a way for me to practice these two languages, I will try to translate articles by myself so be warned that they may be bad...)

I included links to my Twitter and LinkedIn accounts in the sidebar so please feel free to reach out to me anytime if you have comments about my posts, things that you want to see, ideas, suggestions, etc.  

Thank you very much for reading and hope to see you in the next post!
